          <p>
            I acknowledge the land on which this work was created. This land is the traditional territory of the Huron-Wendat and
            Petun First Nations, the Seneca, and the Mississaugas of the Credit River. The territory is the subject of the Dish With
            One Spoon Wampum Belt Covenant, an agreement between the Iroquois Confederacy and Confederacy of the Ojibwe and allied
            nations to peaceably share and care for the resources around the Great Lakes. The Dish with One Spoon Covenant
            characterizes our collective responsibility to each other and to the earth - to take only what we need, leave enough for
            others, and keep the dish clean.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, the meeting place of Tkaronto/Toronto is still the home to many Indigenous people from across Turtle Island. I am
            grateful to have the opportunity to work in the community, on this territory.

          <h3>[player prompt]</h3>
          <p>A speculative perspective of a worm: It’s the future. The earth has passed around the sun around 88 888 888 times since
          the year 2020.</p>
          
          <p>Imagine yourself a researcher—a Terrestrial Isopod (Pillbug), safe underground, exploring the many systems buried just a
          few feet under your computer. Instead of favouring familiar anthropocentric classification systems, you process
          information through scent, vibrations, oscillations, and colour patterns. Sometimes, you identify objects through
          echolocation.</p>
          
          <p>You can switch cursors to navigate other subterranean realms and much can be learned from these alternative
          perspectives. Perhaps the information of the objects you unearth can be processed and relayed back to other arthropod
          cousins through dance or multivariate data visualizations.</p>
          
          <p>Your cursor becomes a bird’s clawed foot, a hoofed hind leg, the delicate tarsus of a cricket’s arm, an antique
          gardening glove or an old relic from the early Holocene… use it to dig into the virtual subterrestrial world of fungi,
          slime, mould, insects, gas lines, plumbing, cables, and discarded objects. </p>

            <h3>MYTHOLOGY AROUND PERMANENCE</h3>
            <p>A grounded understanding of information begins at the physical and biological level (Bates, 2005). While navigating a
            realm composed of human-made systems, consider the notion that the human microbiome hosts a variable ratio of 1:1
            between human cells and other microorganisms like bacteria and fungi (Sender et al., 2016).</p>
